# C++ Practices : Variables and Literals

This repository contains solutions to the practice questions on Variables and Literals from the [Codesdope website](https://www.codesdope.com/practice/cpp-variables-and-literals/), implemented in C++.

## Description

This set of practice questions focuses on understanding variables and literals in C++ programming. It covers topics such as variable declaration, initialization, data types, and usage of literals.

## Questions

The practice questions can be found on the [Codesdope website](https://www.codesdope.com/practice/cpp-variables-and-literals/). They cover various scenarios related to variables and literals in C++.<br>
- **<u>Questions are listed below :</u>**
    + **[Q1 ](/Q1.cpp)** : Store two integers in two variables x and y. Print the sum of the two.
    + **[Q2 ](/Q2.cpp)** : Store two integers in two variables x and y. Print the product of the two.
    + **[Q3 ](/Q3.cpp)** : Write a C++ program to take two integer inputs from user and print sum and product of them.
    + **[Q4 ](/Q4.cpp)** : Take two integer inputs from user. First calculate the sum of two then product of two. Finally, print the sum and product of both obtained results
    + **[Q5 ](/Q5.cpp)** : Write a program to take input of length and breadth of a rectangle from the user and print its area.
    + **[Q6 ](/Q6.cpp)** : Write a C++ program to print an int, a double and a char on screen. 
    + **[Q7 ](/Q7.cpp)** : Print the ASCII value of the character 'h'.
    + **[Q8 ](/Q8.cpp)** : Write a program to assign a value of 100.235 to a double variable and then convert it to int.
    + **[Q9 ](/Q9.cpp)** : Write a program to add 3 to the ASCII value of the character 'd' and print the equivalent character.
    + **[Q10 ](/Q10.cpp)** : Write a program to add an integer variable having value 5 and a double variable having value 6.2. 
    + **[Q11 ](/Q11.cpp)** : Write a program to find the square of the number 3.9.
    + **[Q12 ](/Q12.cpp)** : Take value of length and breath of a rectangle from user as float. Find its area and print it on screen after type casting it to int.
    + **[Q13 ](/Q13.cpp)** : Take a char input from user and print it's ASCII value.
