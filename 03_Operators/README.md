# Operator Practices: C++ Operators

Welcome to the Operator Practices repository, where you can find solutions to various operator-related practice questions implemented in C++.

## Description

This repository focuses on understanding and practicing various operators in C++ programming. It covers topics such as arithmetic operators, relational operators, logical operators, assignment operators, and more.

## Questions

The practice questions can be found in this repository. Each question explores different scenarios related to operators in C++.<br>
- **<u>Questions are listed below :</u>**
    + **[Level 1 Questions](/03_Operators/Level_01)**
        - **[Q1 ](/03_Operators/Level_01/Q1.cpp)** : Length and breadth of a rectangle are 5 and 7 respectively. Write a program to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
        - **[Q2 ](/03_Operators/Level_01/Q2.cpp)** : Write a program to input the value of the radius of a circle from keyboard and then calculate its perimeter and area.
        - **[Q3 ](/03_Operators/Level_01/Q3.cpp)** : Write a program to enter a 4 digit number from the keyboard. Add 8 to the number and then divide it by 3. Now, the modulus of that number is taken with 5 and then multiply the resultant value by 5. Display the final result.
        - **[Q4 ](/03_Operators/Level_01/Q4.cpp)** : Now, solve the above question using assignment operators (eg. +=, -=, *=).
        - **[Q5 ](/03_Operators/Level_01/Q5.cpp)** : Enter two numbers from keyboard. Write a program to check if the two numbers are equal.
        - **[Q6 ](/03_Operators/Level_01/Q6.cpp)** : Write a program to enter the values of two variables 'a' and 'b' from keyboard and then check if both the conditions 'a < 50' and 'a < b' are true.
        - **[Q7 ](/03_Operators/Leve1_01/Q7.cpp)** : Now solve the above question to check if atleast one of the conditions 'a < 50' and 'a < b' is true.
        - **[Q8 ](/03_Operators/Level_01/Q8.cpp)** : If the marks of Robert in three subjects are 78,45 and 62 respectively (each out of 100 ), write a program to calculate his total marks and percentage marks.
        - **[Q9 ](/03_Operators/Level_01/Q9.cpp)** : Write a program to enter the values of two variables from the keyboard and then interchange the values of the two variables. E.g. :   If entered value of x is 5 and y is 10 then     cout <<x << " and " << y    should print 10 and 5.
        - **[Q10 ](/03_Operators/Level_01/Q10.cpp)** : Take input of some length in meter and covert it to feet and inches.
        - **[Q11 ](/03_Operators/Level_01/Q11.cpp)** : Write a program to convert Fahrenheit into Celsius.
        - **[Q12 ](/03_Operators/Level_01/Q12.cpp)** : The total number of students in a class are 45 out of which 25 are boys. If 80% of the total students secured grade 'A' out of which 17 are boys, then write a program to calculate the total number of girls getting grade 'A'.

    + **[Level 2 Questions](/03_Operators/Level_02/)**
        - **[Q1 ](/03_Operators/Level_02/Q1.cpp)** : Write a program to calculate the sum of the first and the second last digit of a 5 digit.    E.g.- NUMBER : 12345    OUTPUT : 1+4=5
        - **[Q2 ](/03_Operators/Level_02/Q2.cpp)** : Take a 4 digit number. Write a program to display a number whose digits are 2 greater than the corresponding digits of the number TAKEN. For example, if the number which was taken is 5696, then the displayed number should be 7818.
        - **[Q3 ](/03_Operators/Level_02/Q3.cpp)** : Write a program to calculate the sum of the digits of a 3-digit number.  Number : 132    Output : 6
        - **[Q4 ](/03_Operators/Level_02/Q4.cpp)** : Write a program to reverse a 3-digit number. E.g.-   Number : 132    Output : 231
